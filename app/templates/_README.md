# This project has been made pretty neat by the Aristos CMS

This is the Node version for the Aristos Content Managment System (CMS).

## Table of Contents



## Getting Started

```
npm install -g generator-aristos
```
When that is done, just make a folder, go into said folder and run the generator.
You will be prompted for information so have this ready before starting the installer:
- Project Name
- Website Name (Not the Url, just the name)
- Mongodb URI 
- admin username
- admin password
Once you have this information, then make whatever you want.
```
mkdir <whatever you name your directory>
cd <whatevevr you named your directory>
yo aristos
```

Soon, [Aristos Builder](https://aristosbuilder.com/) will be a great resource to help you get started. It's just pretty lame right now.
