# Aristos CMS - Node Version
- **Should be production ready within a few updates**

This is the Node version for the Aristos Content Managment System (CMS).

## Getting Started

You will can globally install the project and you will need yo if you do not have it.
```
npm install -g generator-aristos
npm install -g yo
```

When that is done, just make a folder, go into said folder and run the generator.
You will be prompted for information so have this ready before starting the installer:
- Project Name
- Website Name (Not the Url, just the name)
- Mongodb URI 
- Mongodb database name
- admin username
- admin password
Once you have this information, then make whatever you want.

```
mkdir <whatever you name your directory>
cd <whatevevr you named your directory>
yo aristos
```

If you would like to also install an upgrade/plugin package, add the appropiate flag:
```
--blog
--contact
--documentation
--newsletter
--portfolio
--products
--management
```

an example of using a simple or multiple option flags are as shown:
```
yo aristos --blog
yo aristos --products --blog
```

You can also change the default color layout by using the flags:
```
--blue
--orange
--pink
--purple
```
an example of using the color option flags are as shown:
```
yo aristos --blue
```
Each option flag needs a space after it, otherwise two options will be seen by the generator as a single option and not function correctly.

The current state of the upgrade/plugin packages should also be noted:
#### Upgrades
    - blog: very close to be fully working
    - contact: can recieve contact but not much else
    - documentation: Mostly works
    - newsletter: not a thing
    - portfolio: Mostly works, editing images doesnt always work on first try
    - products: Mostly works, orders and coupons still being worked on
    - management: Mostly working
#### Plugins
    - printful: option flag not set, mostly works

Soon, [Aristos Builder](https://aristosbuilder.com/) will be a great resource to help you get started. It's just pretty lame right now.
