# Aristos Generator
- **Finalizing the update stream**
- **project will be production ready after rewrite**

This is the Node version for the Aristos Content Managment System (CMS).

## Getting Started

```
npm install -g generator-aristos
```
When that is done, just make a folder, go into said folder and run the generator.
You will be prompted for information so have this ready before starting the installer:
- Project Name
- Website Name (Not the Url, just the name)
- Mongodb URI 
- admin username
- admin password
Once you have this information, then make whatever you want.
```
mkdir <whatever you name your directory>
cd <whateevr you named your directory>
yo aristos
```

Soon, [Aristos Builder](https://aristosbuilder.com/) will be a great resource to help you get started. It's just pretty lame right now.
